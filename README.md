# Attended
## Video Demo: https://youtu.be/OY3F1sHQvgg
#### Description:
## What is the problem in my area?
#### Teaching organizations are manually documenting students details on paper and when sharing details of the student, Teachers must go through folders just to look for a students details
## What is Attended Solving?
#### It gives a place where Teachers can store student records and easilly access them using a search filter and significantly reducing the time taken to search for the students details. Attended also has an attendance tracking feature that allows teachers to take the student attendance.
#### Teachers are given the power to add and remove students in their class seamlessly.
## What are some design features?
#### I went for a simple design but elegant. I feel I designed the application to be user friendly so that anyone could use Attended.
